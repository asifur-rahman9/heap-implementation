# **Heap Implementation in Java**

## **Overview**

This project implements a **Heap Data Structure** in Java, along with supporting classes to handle entries and dynamic array operations. The program demonstrates key heap functionalities such as insertion, deletion, and retrieval of the minimum/maximum element, using Java-based custom classes for efficient and scalable operations.

## **Features**

- **Custom Heap Implementation**:
  - Supports Min-Heap or Max-Heap configurations.
  - Provides insertion, deletion, and peek operations.

- **Dynamic Array**:
  - The `ExpandableArray` class dynamically adjusts its size to store heap elements efficiently.

- **Entry Management**:
  - The `Entry` class is used for creating key-value pairs for heap elements.

## **Applications of Heap**

- Priority Queues
- Graph Algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra’s, Prim’s)
- Scheduling Systems
- Sorting (Heap Sort)
